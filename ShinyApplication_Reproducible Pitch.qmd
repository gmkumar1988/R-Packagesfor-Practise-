## Instructions

-   Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
-   Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
-   Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
-   Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

## Code

```{r}
###ui.R
library(shiny)
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Predicting the price of a diamond"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      sliderInput("sliderCarat", "What is price of a diamond?", 0, 6, value = 0.1),
      checkboxInput("showModel", "Show/Hide regression line", value = TRUE),
      submitButton("Submit") 
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("plot"),
      h3("Predicted price of a diamond:"),
      textOutput("pred"),
      
    )
  )
))


```

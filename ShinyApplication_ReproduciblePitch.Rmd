## Overview

This application was designed for Developing Data Products - Shiny Application Reproducible Pitch.

This part of the assignment to create a Shiny application  and reproducible pitch can be found here using inbuilt dataset mtcars:

## Takeawway

- Motor Trend US Magazine collected data (11 variable) on 32 automobiles
- By using this application module, the cost of gasoline traveling some distance in one of the 32

## Data and Variables 
mpg = Miles/ galon  
cyl = Number of cylinders used
disp = Displacement
hp = Gross Horsepower 
drat = Rear Axle Ration
wt = Weight
am = Transmission Mode (Automatic or Manual)

##Glimse of data output:

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
head(mtcars) 

```

<!-- ## Slide with Plot -->

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

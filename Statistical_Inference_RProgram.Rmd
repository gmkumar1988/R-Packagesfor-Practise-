###Using rexp, we will create 40 random exponential distributions using lambda = 0.2, take the mean of this 40 draws and create a data vector with 1500 of these means. Than analyse the distribution of the value of the means. We are searchind the kind of distribution they will be disposed

for (i in 1:1500)simulationMeans = c(simulationMeans,mean(rexp(exponentials, lambda)))
